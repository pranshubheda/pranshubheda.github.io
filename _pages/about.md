I am a Software Engineer with a passion for understanding and building complex systems. I am currently working on building a robust and secure login and registration platform for a bank. I have experience with building cloud native multi-tenant applications. In my free time I like to spend time on small hardware projects like building a LED matrix and RC cars. On this page I will be writing blogs about whats on my mind and anything cool I came across. Apart from technical work I also enjoy delving in the realm of movies, politics and business. This page is meant to be a window into my thoughts.  

Thanks for stopping by!
